  - Highlight the **interests** and **platform preferences** most relevant to these audience segments.
  - Identify any **patterns** that suggest audience engagement or content consumption behaviors (e.g., frequent use of Instagram, preference for video content).

### 3. Step 3: Marketing Recommendations
